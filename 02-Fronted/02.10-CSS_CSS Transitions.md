### css-transitions-animatable-properties
CSS transitions enable us to control the timing of visual state changes. Color, background color, font size, width, and height are all states that can be transitioned.

### css-transitions-four-components
CSS Transitions have 4 components:

### A property that will transition.
The duration which describes how long the transition takes.
The delay to pause before the transition will take place.
The timing function that describes the transitionâ€™s acceleration.
transition-duration-default-value
If a value is not given for transition-duration, by default, the value is 0s. This mean no animation will occur.

### css-transition-timing-function
The transition-timing-function property is used to describe how a transition will advance over its duration. Values such as ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, and linear allows a transition to change speed during its course.

### css-transition-delay
The transition-delay describes when the transition effect will start. The unit specified by this value is defined in seconds s or milliseconds ms.

### transition-properties-comma
Two (or more) CSS properties can be triggered in a single transition by separating them with a comma.

### transition-property-all
all is a value for transition-property that causes every changing property to transition.

### css-transition-shorthand-syntax
The transition CSS property is the shorthand syntax for transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.
