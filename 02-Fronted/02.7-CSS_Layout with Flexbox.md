### CSS Flexbox
The CSS display: flex property sets an HTML element as a block level flex container which takes the full width of its parent container. Any child elements that reside within the flex container are called flex items.

Flex items change their size and location in response to the size and position of their parent container.

```css
div {
  display: flex;
}
```

### justify-content Property
The CSS justify-content flexbox property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of their container. This is when the content items do not use all available space on the major-axis (horizontally).

justify-content can have the values of:

flex-start
flex-end
center
space-between
space-around

```css
/* Items based at the center of the parent container: */
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

/* Items based at the upper-left side of the parent container: */
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-start;
}
```

### flex Property
The flex CSS property specifies how a flex item will grow or shrink so as to fit within the space available in its flex container. This is a shorthand property that declares the following properties in order on a single line:


flex-grow
flex-shrink
flex-basis

```css
/* Three properties declared on three lines: */
.first-flex-item {
  flex-grow: 2;
  flex-shrink: 1; 
  flex-basis: 150px;
}

/* Same three properties declared on one line: */
.first-flex-item {
  flex: 2 1 150px;
}
```

### flex-direction Property
The flex-direction CSS property specifies how flex items are placed in the flex container - either vertically or horizontally. This property also determines whether those flex items appear in order or in reverse order.

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row-reverse; 
}
```

### align-content Property
The align-content property modifies the behavior of the flex-wrap property. It determines how to space rows from top to bottom (ie. along the cross axis). Multiple rows of items are needed for this property to take effect.

### flex-grow Property
The CSS flex-grow property allows flex items to grow as the parent container increases in size horizontally. This property accepts numerical values and specifies how an element should grow relative to its sibling elements based on this value.

The default value for this property is 0.

```css
.panelA {
  width: 100px;
  flex-grow: 1;
}

/* This panelB element will stretch twice wider than the panelA element */
.panelB {
  width: 100px;
  flex-grow: 2; 
}
```


### flex-shrink Property
The CSS flex-shrink property determines how an element should shrink as the parent container decreases in size horizontally. This property accepts a numerical value which specifies the ratios for the shrinkage of a flex item compared to its other sibling elements within its parent container.

The default value for this property is 1.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item-a {
  flex-shrink: 1; 
  /* The value 1 indicates that the item should shrink. */
}

.item-b {
  flex-shrink: 2; 
  /* The value 2 indicates that the item should shrink twice than the element item-a. */
}
```

### Css flex-basis property
The flex-basis CSS property sets the initial base size for a flex item before any other space is distributed according to other flex properties.

```css
// Default Syntax
flex-basis: auto;
```

### The CSS flex-flow property
The CSS property flex-flow provides a shorthand for the properties flex-direction and flex-wrap. The value of the flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flex items and the value of the flex-wrap property allows flex items to move to the next line instead of shrinking to fit inside the flex container. The flex-flow property should be declared on the flex container.

// In this example code block, "column" is the value of the property "flex-direction" and "wrap" is the value of the property "flex-wrap".

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column wrap;
}
```

### CSS display: inline-flex property
The CSS display: inline-flex property sets an HTML element as an inline flex container which takes only the required space for the content. Any child elements that reside within the flex container are called flex items. Flex items change their size and location in response to the size and position of their parent container.

```css
.container{
  display: inline-flex;
}
```

### Flexbox Properties align-items
When working with CSS flexbox align-items is used to align flex items vertically within a parent container.

### Css flex-wrap property
The flex-wrap property specifies whether flex items should wrap or not. This applies to flex items only. Once you tell your container to flex-wrap, wrapping become a priority over shrinking. Flex items will only begin to wrap if their combined flex-basis value is greater than the current size of their flex container.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  width: 200px;
}
```
